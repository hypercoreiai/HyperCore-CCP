"""serve/fixtures/legacy_engine.py - the text-pipe engine, kept for tests only.

Production runs the binary IPC worker (serve/hypercore_supervisor.py). This class
speaks the old `GEN ...` / `T <id>` / `DONE ...` protocol over stdout, and nothing in
serve/server.py constructs it any more. It stays because test_lifecycle, test_parallel,
test_vram and test_server exercise start-failure, silence-detection and DONE-parsing
paths that only the text protocol has.

It is a fixture, not a supported engine: no production code imports it, and it is not
wired to the wire contract.

Why serve/fixtures/ and not tests/fixtures/: tests/ is the C++ suite tree (core, cuda,
hip, prefill). Python test helpers live next to the code they test.
